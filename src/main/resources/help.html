    <p>Some tips and tricks:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To create flat round label (to be put on a flat base top, instead of
        a sloped base edge), set height to 0.</li>
      <li>To create plain rectangular label, set covered angle to 0. In such
        a situation, diameters become the length of its top and bottom side. By
        specifying different lengths, it's possible to create a trapeze label.</li>
      <li>It may be easier to print the resulting image, if page size is reduced
        to include margins (and normal margins are set to 0), instead of using
        full page size with normal margins. For example use page size of 160x247
        with 0mm margins, instead of page size of 210x297 with 25mm margins, to
        print on A4 paper.</li>
      <li>Make sure the image is printed at correct DPI, to achieve desired
        results.</li>
      <li>In the editor you can only see preview of the first label in each set,
        only the resulting image will contain them all.</li>
      <li>This tool is (for now) able to create only a single image out of all
        data. If there are too many labels, they might not fit. In such
        circumstances divide them between multiple data files.</li>
      <li>Please post any issues you have here <a href="issues">https://github.com/morvael/labeler/issues</a>.</li>
